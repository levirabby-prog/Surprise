# Happy Birthday Surprise 🎉

This is a simple GitHub Pages project made as a birthday surprise for **Meri Jaan**.  

## How it works
- Open the live GitHub Pages link.
- You’ll see a personalized animated birthday message with confetti.  
- Built using plain **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** (no frameworks, no sensitive data).  

## Notes
- This repo can be safely deleted after the surprise to make the page disappear.  
- To turn off GitHub Pages without deleting, go to **Settings → Pages → Branch → set to None**.  

Made with ❤️
